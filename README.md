### Useful resources

-   [Blog 1](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/how-to-build-an-accordion-using-only-html--cms-106881t) - This helped me on how to structure HTML properly first and then apply CSS. Also I came to know that this same functionality can be implemented alternately using <details> tag as well and without any javascript.

-   [Blog 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-accordion-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript/) - This blog helped me understand on how javascript can be used with HTML and CSS.
